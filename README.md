# BWUI -Capstone Project by Katherine Huynh
===

Thank you for taking the time to review my capstone project. Whilst I edit a university website as my day job, I only get to dabble in code a little, as the master template is locked down. So, the Codecademy Pro course was both fun and a huge learning curve. 

The submitted code represents my best attempt at taking what I learnt.

## Required tasks

* Space around the grids - I was able to manipulate the spacing around grid items to make them easier to view.
* Implement headings and text styles - I did my best on this task, and found a similar font of the text in the category images. I'm pleased with how the footer navigation has improved as a result, but can see that I could have spent time adjusting the line height to make this more easy to read.
* Styling links - this was my favourite part. I gave them an orange twist with a little bolding. I would have like to make a transition for the category images when hovered over, but despite research, I couldn't find out how to do this. I also enjoyed styling the breadcrumb navigation. I didn't understand why my title text didn't result in a mouse-over. It does on the website I edit. I would have liked to have done this.
* Coding for a screen reader - This is very challenging for me. I was able to code basic titles and alt text, however implementing <main> tag on a page skewed the layout, so I removed the code and didn't proceed with this further. This is a good skill to master though.
* Colour palette - I enjoyed giving the site a sprinkling of pumpkin orange.

##My goals

* Styling links, introducing font hierarchy and a colour palette - I enjoyed implementing these aspects with a view to helping customers enjoy browsing the site more, as I believe a furniture purchase is part emotive and part functional. A cohesive design can also help guide customers what to do.
* Highlighting furniture prices - This was a fun thing to code. I wanted people with a budget to be able to see the price easily, including when an item is on sale. Ultimately, this could be done by crossing out the full price and showing the discounted price alongside. There are many tactics for this, but something like this would potentially motivate a customer to purchase.
* Enhance the display for mobile - This was challenging for me. I looked back over the grid lesson and couldn't figure out how to properly make the site responsive. This is something I'd like to learn better.
* Amping up the descriptive text - I spent a little time renaming products with slightly more jazzy names, to capture the interest of customers.
